## tl;dr on gotlin

As a means to better understand Kotlin's coroutines by way of my prior understanding of Go's goroutines, I wrote [gotlin][gotlin] which reimplements the goroutine examples from [The Go Programming Language][gopl] book in Kotlin with coroutines.

*In no way do the authors of "The Go Programming Language" endorse this or this use.*

## Why?

Understanding coroutines is difficult and their incorrect use results in major service issues. Source: I've reviewed the severe event retrospectives where the root cause was improper use of [`useBlocking`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html). This leads some to have an irrational fear of coroutines.

Because of this, I set out to better understand coroutines. While watching [a talk](TK) that demonstrated the use of Kotlin's [`select`](TK) it clicked that part of my misunderstanding of coroutines is that they're very similar to Go's goroutines.  I was treating them too similarly in my head. While at the same time, I didn't have may great practical examples of coroutines **in use.**

I set out to better understand coroutines by directly comparing them to the goroutine code examples in [The Go Programming Language][gopl] book. While I only occasionally use Go professionally, I think this book is absolutely top-notch; easily one of the best programming language books on my shelf.

## Suggested use

Granted, this is targeted at a pretty niche category:

1. Developers who know Go and its goroutines reasonably well
2. Also don't know Kotlin's coroutines reasonably well

That said, the way to use it is:

1. Have a copy of [the book][gopl]
2. Pull up [the book's source code][gocode]
3. Pull up [gotlin][gotlin] and compare side-by-side

## Lessons learned

There are more details in the [gotlin README][gotlin-readme] but here are some higher level things I learned

First, just like in grade-school, let's compare and contrast the two:

### Compare

- Both provide/are a super lightweight alternative to Threads
- Both support sharing memory by communication (rather than communicating via shared memory)

### Contrast

I think this is the key point: **Many of the differences between goroutines and coroutines come down to philosophical design differences between the Go and Kotlin programming languages.**

#### Go / goroutines

Go emphasizes simplicity, practically above all else. For example, its runtime has a garbage collector, but very few ways to tune it. Of course it has for-loops, but no functional equivalents of map/reduce/filter. **Go's philosophy seems to be to prefer to remove what can be removed from the language and only add features when there's been a clear demonstrated need over time.** This is in stark contrast to many languages that absorb features quite easily, like C++. Which of course makes sense given that it was born out of dissatisfaction with C++. This explains why it took so long for Go to support Generics.

Back to goroutines, this minimalist philosophy shows up in how goroutines work:

- Goroutines baked into the language via `go`, as are channels. This allows them special in/out channel syntax and `select`
- Goroutines are unmanaged. Go doesn't give a way to cancel them and will let you exit your program without closing out goroutines.

#### Kotlin / coroutines

On the other hand, Kotlin is anything but minimalist; it's practically maximalist. Kotlin tries to provide what's best for you but lets you decide what you're most comfortable with. And like its ancestor, Java, it provides some built-in managed functionality.

Along with that philosophy, some distinctions around Kotlin's coroutines are:

- Coroutines are provided via [a library, kotlinx.coroutines,](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) and not within the language itself. It's a testament to Kotlin's flexibility that it can just bolt-on coroutines like this.
- This "bolt-on" approach does mean there has to be a bridge between "normal" Kotlin and "coroutine" Kotlin. This is `runBlocking` and it's important to not step through this bridge twice!
- This "bolt-on" also results in limitations, e.g. [`select`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.selects/select.html) cannot have clauses send and receive from the same channel.
- Kotlin's coroutine library also provides some pre-built common patterns, unlike Go which expects you to build them yourself:
  - `launch` and `async` return `Job` and `Deferred`, which allow for management of the child coroutines. This includes the ability to cancel, which Go does not directly support.
  - [coroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) where any child coroutine failure causes them all to fail
  - [supervisorScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html) for isolating child sub-coroutine failures

### Project learnings

I took on this project with two goals, both intentionally limited in scope:

1. Better understand Kotlin coroutines so I can use them effectively
2. Hopefully provide a resource to help others also better understand

I will have to wait and see if #2 is met, but I definitely met my #1 goal.

A large part of that was due to the [very helpful expert PRs from dump247](https://github.com/valbaca/gotlin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+user%3Adump247). Going into this, I expected it to be a self-study, code, then release process. I tend to run solo and I never really understood "study groups." I didn't even consider or expect anyone else to contribute, but I've learned more from his contributions than I would've on my own.
