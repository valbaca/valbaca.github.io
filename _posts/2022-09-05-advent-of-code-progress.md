# Advent of Code

What is Advent of Code? Well, go to[https://adventofcode.com/]()

Okay, but **what is it?** Go to [https://adventofcode.com/2021/about]

Primarily, I've used Advent of Code as a fun way to keep my coding skills from atrophying during times where I'm coding less at work **and** it serves as a great way to learn new languages by forcing me to interact with typical things like:

- reading and writing from a file
- splitting input by line
- parsing
- basic list and map operations
- some intermediate structures, like heaps and graphs
- the part 1 / part 2 stucture is a nice example of changing requirements

Putting my progress into a single place to make tracking easier:

## My Advent packages by language with thoughts

- Python: [valbaca/advent-py](https://github.com/valbaca/advent-py)
  - Python is #1 for a reason, both in general and especially with Advent of Code solvers.
  - Does run into perf issues, even on reasonable algorithms.
  - It looks like I'll primarily be using Python at work, so I'm going to focus on Python.
- Go: [valbaca/advent-go](https://github.com/valbaca/advent-go)
  - I've used Advent to learn Go. Go is eating Java, so I needed to be familiar with it.
  - Incredibly fast to compile and execute (~50x compared to Python), but can be downright boring and tedious to write.
  - I really miss niceties of (nearly every other) language.
  - I *thought* I was going to use Go for my primary coding language at work, but when I started I found it's purely Python
- Java & Clojure: [valbaca/advent](https://github.com/valbaca/advent)
  - Java has been the language I've used most for the past 10 years in my career, but I wanted to learn Clojure.
  - I've used Advent to learn Clojure. I reach for Java occassionally for perf and familiarity.
  - Certainly discovered some of the Clojure super-powers: writing a input file reader that uses the namespace of the file is some cool magic.
  - REPL is awesome, but initial startup, REPL connection pains, and absurd memory usage really drag.
- Crystal: [valbaca/AdventOfCode-Crystal](https://github.com/valbaca/AdventOfCode-Crystal)
  - Again, used Advent of Code to help learn, but hardly got far at all.
  - Super fast to execute, tad bit slow to compile. No good debugger or IDE.
  - I really wish Crystal fulfilled that sweet spot of Ruby syntax at C speed...but it has essentially no tools.
- JS/TS: ...nah
  - JavaScript is an "if you must" language, but I'm sure it would be just fine for Advent problems.
- Rust: ...maybe someday?
