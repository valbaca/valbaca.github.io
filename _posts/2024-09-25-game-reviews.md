## Finish Them!

I've been working to *finish* (roll credits) on some unfinished games lately. I personally get overwhelmed if I have too many "open threads." Too many unfinished books and games and I get stressed; as in, around three. So as I started finding games I wanted to play, I found myself needing to finish some (damn) games first. Here's a quick review of some games that were stuck in my In Progress queue for too long.

- Doom (1993)
- Alan Wake Remastered
- Tales of Kenzera: Zau
- Lords of the Fallen
- Another Crab's Treasure 

## Doom (1993)

What HAS NOT been said about The O.G. FPS?

As a kid I only got to play the first level bc my introduction and only initial experience PC games was a demo CD that my grandpa had on his computer. So basically, I never got around to *actually* playing Doom.

It was basically free on PS5 so I finally got it. Which is honestly hilarious given that it's been ported to EVERY device imaginable and I could've played it in True Fashion a thousand times, but no, had to wait until it was available on the most-overpowered dedicated game-machine in 2024 to finally play the most iconic video game in existence.

It was great. Only the second to last missions in the fourth/extra episode "Thy Flesh Consumed" was a bit clunky as they went a bit too far with the "puzzle" aspect of the levels.

A couple of design aspects that I especially liked are:
- shared ammo between guns. Kept true in Doom Eternal, having different weapons share the same ammo type is good design
- super health; there's some items that give you a small amount of health but they let your health go above 100% unlike normal medpacks. So there's a bit of optimization where it's better to pick them up at 100% health but that option isn't often available

**Review: 10/10 still GOATed duh**

## [Alan Wake Remastered (2022, original 2010)](https://www.alanwake.com/remastered/)

Fuck. This. Game.

Story? Fine; *maybe* good. The use of light/dark got super derivative but one could also say it's meta.

But OMG the gameplay is absolutely atrocious. I *really* wanted to actually finish the games on my list, and not just give up on them but Alan Wake took every ounce of my will to *actually* get there.

I've never wanted a game to NOT be the kind of video game it is and instead be any other form of interactive media.

**Review 0/10. Pure Hatred**

## [Tales of Kenzera: Zau (2024)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2316580/Tales_of_Kenzera_ZAU/)

While it starts with a strong framed narrative and a good first two acts, it fully falls apart in the second half by just completely dropping the story on the floor. Plus tons of game-state bugs: clipping out of "locked" fights, tasks not clearing after completion, music getting stuck, etc etc.

It's just so hard to come close to Ori in this genre

**Review: 2/10. There's a reason you haven't heard of this game**

## [Lords of the Fallen (2023)](https://lordsofthefallen.com/)

The latest big Soulslike. I was SUPER hyped for this game when the trailer dropped and (like many other games on this list) stuck with it much longer than I should've.

I actually put this game down for several months, even fully uninstalling it because I ran into multiple game-crashes on the old version. For the first time ever, I thought about seeking an actual **refund** on the PS Store but I think I was just a few days too late.

After seeing on Reddit that a major version update had been released, I gave it another shot.

It has a really cool "shadow world" called Umbral. Like most shadow/mirror dimensions in games, it's a clever way to basicaly double the world for probably not double the code. It's a tale as old as Zelda. The game has some unique interactions with this shadow world that I really enjoyed.

However, I did not enjoy this game. When most people say "soulslike" they don't often mean "All the *fun* of Dark Souls **2** but with none of the soul" I think a major contributor was that I tried just going with a Strength build. Big Sword is fun in actual Souls games but got *very* boring very quickly.

The best part was when my friend Natalie joined me streaming the game for The Game's Most Boring Boss fight. It was just a dude with a hammer in a 30x30ft square.

**Review 3/10. Miiight be re-playable but probably never will**


## [Another Crab's Treasure (2024)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887840/Another_Crabs_Treasure/)

Another "soulslike" but with a twist and a beat-you-over-the-head message.

However, the last act gets super muddled, drags out, and completely drops storylines flat on their face.

The shell-swapping mechanic is fun but easily solve: The Valve is OP.

**Review 4/10**

## Conclusion

This is why I love to write. It wasn't until I wrote this up that I realized that there's probably more value in *just dropping games* that aren't doing it it for me.

There have been some notable exceptions of games worth "slogging" through, but after this latest batch of flops, I might just listen to my gaming gut more.

## Next Post: React?

I'm back in the saddle of doing web development for dollars again, especially working with React. I'm thinking of doing a post on some dev tech that I like: Tanstack/React Query, Remix, and mise-en-place are some on top of mind.
