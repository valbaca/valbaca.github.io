I am Valentin Baca [@val_baca](https://twitter.com/val_baca) and this is my blog.

I'm a staff software engineer with 12+ years of industry experience, mostly at Amazon.com and most of that time on AmazonSmile [RIP](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-closing-amazonsmile-to-focus-its-philanthropic-giving-to-programs-with-greater-impact). I'm currently working at [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/).

I really love programming and I especially love learning new programming languages. So I plan to mostly write about that. In practice, I've mostly worked professionally in Java/Kotlin plus JavaScript/TypeScript. I also know Go, Python, Clojure, and Rust.

In my free-time, if I'm not reading a programming book, I also play Magic The Gathering, I lift weights, and I'm learning guitar.
