I am Valentin Baca [@val_baca](https://twitter.com/val_baca) and this is my blog.

I'm a staff software engineer with 12+ years of industry experience, mostly at Amazon.com I spent most of that time on Amazon Wine ([R.I.P. ðŸª¦](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/amazon-wine-is-shutting-down/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANTAUiPcKjvPwd3Ygscw0ok7Fs4i0b8OytmSJeX7asp6lfs8gMQ0TPTDoa6M39kGMu9_rzrsmjdzBvk8q7o107qO-0fd_W7tvEQRPJ1oqNJesJhL_vjajGTC5-GOTFcmqzqFhuHwcDptG5u46vY54Pk77z_FJmcyM4jnZWzY07wD)) and AmazonSmile ([R.I.P. ðŸª¦](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-closing-amazonsmile-to-focus-its-philanthropic-giving-to-programs-with-greater-impact)). I'm currently working at [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/).

I really love programming and I especially love learning new programming languages. So I plan to mostly write about that. In practice, I've mostly worked professionally in Java/Kotlin plus JavaScript/TypeScript. I also know Go, Python, Clojure, and Rust.

In my free-time, if I'm not reading a programming book, I also play Magic The Gathering, I lift weights, and I'm learning guitar.
