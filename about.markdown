This is a blog by Valentin Baca [@val_baca](https://twitter.com/val_baca)

I'm a senior software engineer with 10+ years of industry experience, mostly at Amazon.com and most of that time at [AmazonSmile](https://smile.amazon.com/).

I really love programming and I especially love learning new programming languages. So I plan to mostly write about that. In practice, I've mostly written Java, Objective-C, and JavaScript to pay the bills. 

In my free-time, if I'm not reading a programming book, I also play Magic The Gathering, I lift weights, and I'm learning guitar.
